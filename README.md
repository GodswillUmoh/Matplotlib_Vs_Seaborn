# Matplotlib_Vs_Seaborn
The two are python libraries us for visualization. Some will ask which should I use. The answer is not necessarily yes or no.
Both complement each other and very useful in what the programmer whats to achieve. In this report, I run visuals with Matplotlib and seaborn.

## Defining The terms
